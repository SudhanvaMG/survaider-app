First impressions seemed ok, we paid our money, 4000 rupees, and the porter took our backpacks to our room. When we returned from the our day exploring, we had no water at all in the shower and toilet. As we left our room a young guy appeared and told us he would get it fixed. 20 mins later we hadn't heard anything and still no water so we went to reception. They informed us that maintenance had turned it off to fix a problem. This was ok, just would have liked to been told this in the first place. We then noticed that the room was quite dirty. After looking on line, we realised that the room rate was actually 2000, half of what we had been charged. We headed down to reception again and challenged the manager, who is the rudest person I have ever had the misfortune to deal with. After showing us different room types and trying to convince us we had paid for an upgrade, which was total lies, we realised we were fighting a losing battle and gave up. We agreed to have our room cleaned. 5 bed sheets later and 2 sets of towels later we decided this was as clean as it was going to be.The following morning, we arranged our airport transfer, which was included in the rip off price. They offered to carry our bags which we refused but they were very insistent. The young boy then asked us THREE times for a tip!The car that arrived was very old and I am sure not roadworthy. In the middle of a busy road, the driver turned to us and was so busy telling us that we had to tip him, he almost hit a pedestrian.I can't even bring myself to call this building a hotel, the place is dirty, the staff were extremely rude, unhelpful and creepy. This place and the people working here totally ruined our stay in Mumbai.We were totally ripped off, unfortunately because we didn't have access to wifi until we checked into the room, it was to late. There are other hotels in Mumbai that are the same price as this one that are so much nicer and probably in a nicer location too.\n",

I arrived in Mumbai domestic airport mid-morning and needed a hotel for the rest of the day and a few hours that night until my international flight. Didn't have a working mobile or laptop (big mistake) so went to the 'helpdesk' in the airport lobby and asked them to book me into a hotel that I'd chosen from the guidebook. Guy told me that hotel would be 4,000 rupees but that I could have a room in the Check Inn hotel for 2,800R, and he showed me photos on-line which looked fine. Got suspicious when he asked for cash upfront and when I said I didn't have cash he asked me to go to the ATM and get it - again I refused. Bockety old car came to pick me up from the terminal, the driver was polite and friendly, but I baulked when I saw the hotel - from the outside it looked dilapidated and run-down and the street was very noisy. To the consternation of the VERY pushy hotel staff who quickly surrounded the car, I said the street was too noisy, so I paid the driver, grabbed my suitcase and just kept walking..... When I read these reviews I see that my instinct to leave was right and that I had a very lucky escape. Beware the accommodation 'helpdesk' at Mumbai airport, do your homework before you arrive in the city and avoid the Check Inn hotel!\n",

I accidently went past the reception floor to the bottom floor of the hotel to find huge piles of garbage, large holes in the walls and rats the size of Labradors running around. We tried to sleep for a few hours but it was too noisy, elevator made a loud beeping noise every 5 minutes, kids screaming and running around the corridors, loud noises from the slum behind the hotel and workmen using a drill till 10pm. The icing on the cake was the price, 5200 rupees for one night and the staff were very pushy asking for large tips. This was the most expensive hotel we stayed in in India and by far the worst.

It was 4000 rupees for one night and omg we were ripped off.At first they were nice and friendly, showed us 3 different room types so we could pick, we choose standard and then they took our bags up to the room etc and it was great so we went out for the day. When we came bak to the room, ready for a shower there was no water, not even dribbles. So we went to complain (stayed on the first floor and all the staff seem to linger) we tried to go dwn to reception but the boy said he would sort it, although couldnt speak english. 20 mins later still no water so we went dwn to reception and he explained that theres maintenance and its been switched off bt will b bak on soon. We were fine with that. After looking at the room we realised the room was actually quite dirty for the price we paid. It was then i looked online and found the other reviews, and the prices its advertised as. Our room should have been 2000. At this point the water was on, not hot and toilet didnt flush! So bak dwn to reception to be met by some smartly dressed little indian man, who we presume is the manager. We asked what our room type is and he clearly said it was a standard double, i asked him about the prices online and he sed we were in a deluxe double! He also sed that online is the old owners which hasnt been removed so if we booked through that our money would have gone and no booking! The printed price list also sed we should have paid less for the room bt he tried to tell us we were in a deluxe! We then made him show us the other room types and the 'standard' was the same as ours and wen we sed were downgrade and take the difference in money bak he refused! He also then stated we were wasting his time. After a full arguement we werent getting anywhere so made him sort our room out. He ovcourse dissapeared and sent others to the room. We needed another 5 bed sheets beforw they found a clean one, same for pillow cases and towels. The matress was stained and wen asked what tht was they sed hair oil, the place it was on the matress it wasnt oil! They recleaned the whole room, which was better bt not great. Then freaked out that everytime we opened our door one of the workers was there, he also asked us both for a picture! Next morning we had airport drop off included, one of the boys took our bags to the car and still asked for a tip 3 times! We got in this random battered car and told the driver the hotel has paid etc but he ws saying we can tip him, he turnt round to say this to us and nearly hit a man! And then wondered y we didnt tip! This so called hotel is absolutly disgusting, from the rooms to the service. We wished we went on trip advisor first, they truely ruined mumbai for us!\n",
